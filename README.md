# ELI5: What does the Ava Protocol do?


**Ethereum** is a type of money. You can give and receive money to and from other people by writing commands on your computer.

**Ethereum** is also a **network**. This is a bunch of different computers around the world, talking to each other all the time, over the internet.

**Ethereum** uses **algorithms** that make it **reliable**. This means that you can also write commands on your computer to **say that something should happen**, and Ethereum guarantees that it will happen. 

For example, you can write a command that someone gets some money at some point in time - or if something particular happens.




Scheduled Payments: Automatically transfer ETH or tokens to another address at regular intervals (e.g., paying monthly subscriptions).
Automated Trading Strategies: Execute buy/sell orders when certain market conditions are met (e.g., token price reaches a specific value).
Auto-Compounding Rewards: Reinvest rewards from staking or liquidity pools to maximize returns without manual action.
Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically sell assets if their value drops below a certain threshold to mitigate losses.
Why Do People Want This?

Efficiency: Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
Precision: Executes tasks exactly when conditions are met, which is crucial in fast-moving markets.
Risk Management: Helps protect investments by automating responses to market changes.
Enhanced User Experience: Simplifies complex interactions with blockchain networks.

2. Does It Support Off-Chain Transfers?
While Ava Protocol focuses on automating on-chain transactions, it also supports off-chain computations and interactions. This includes:

Off-Chain Data Integration: Using off-chain data to trigger on-chain actions (e.g., weather data, stock prices).
External API Calls: Making HTTP or GraphQL requests to external services as part of a task.
Note: It does not directly facilitate transferring assets to off-chain entities like banks or centralized exchanges. Instead, it can interact with off-chain data to inform on-chain actions.

3. What Kinds of Tasks Can We Create in the API?
Types of Tasks:

ETH Transfers: Automate sending ETH to specified addresses under certain conditions.
Contract Executions: Call functions on smart contracts with specified parameters.
Scheduled Tasks: Set up tasks to execute at specific times or intervals (using cron expressions).
Conditional Tasks: Tasks that trigger when certain on-chain or off-chain conditions are met (e.g., token price reaches a target).
Expression-Based Tasks: Use custom expressions to define complex conditions for task execution.
