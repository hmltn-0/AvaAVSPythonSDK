Understanding Ava Protocol and Its Requirements

Let's start by addressing your questions and then proceed to provide a step-by-step guide to building the SDK in Python.

1. How Does Ava Protocol Automate Ethereum?
Ava Protocol automates Ethereum by allowing users to set up tasks that automatically execute transactions or smart contract functions based on predefined conditions or triggers. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and enables seamless and timely execution of actions.

Concrete Examples:

Scheduled Payments: Automatically transfer ETH or tokens to another address at regular intervals (e.g., paying monthly subscriptions).
Automated Trading Strategies: Execute buy/sell orders when certain market conditions are met (e.g., token price reaches a specific value).
Auto-Compounding Rewards: Reinvest rewards from staking or liquidity pools to maximize returns without manual action.
Stop-Loss Orders: Automatically sell assets if their value drops below a certain threshold to mitigate losses.
Why Do People Want This?

Efficiency: Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
Precision: Executes tasks exactly when conditions are met, which is crucial in fast-moving markets.
Risk Management: Helps protect investments by automating responses to market changes.
Enhanced User Experience: Simplifies complex interactions with blockchain networks.
